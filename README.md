# Handbook for student affiliates

Repository for the CDL Handbook for Student Affiliates at [https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/handbook](https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/handbook)

Create new handbook pages in the `drafts` folder. When they're ready, move them to the top level of the `docs` folder for publication. See the [sample draft page](drafts/sampledraft.md) in `drafts`.

New pages should be written in markdown and have YAML front matter at the top like so:

```
---
layout: page
title: My new page
author: Firstname Lastname
---
```

What you put in the `title` field will automatically show up as the page title at the top of the page. The page will automatically be listed in the sidebar navigation and in the list of pages on the site home page.
